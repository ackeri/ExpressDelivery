Blueprint problmes:
No modules in rocket loaders
some sort of error with commuter
Can get into steel furnaces faster
Need to rely on fulgora more
Need more landmine creation
Automate tanks
A bunch of blueprints rely on bots before they exist
Gleba didn't get red belts
Fulgora tried to use too many roboframes
Fulgora some pipes for offshore pumps
Can't make nearly as much rocket components on Nauvis as I hoped
Huge red circuit bottlneck when we hit robots.
